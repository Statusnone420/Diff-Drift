# Engine v2 scorecard

Measurement battery for the `engine-v2` branch. Every phase ends with the full battery; a
regression in any metric blocks the next phase. Criterion numbers are absolute medians from
this machine (Win11, same session) — the deltas criterion prints against older local runs
are ignored.

## Battery results by phase

| Metric | Baseline (Phase 0) | Phase 1 (structural core) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo test` | 104 passed, 0 failed | 112 passed, 0 failed |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings` | clean | clean |
| `npm run eval:engine` | 15/15 | 15/15 |
| `npm run test:unit` | 54 passed | 54 passed |
| `npm run test:e2e:web` | 2 passed (incl. axe) | 2 passed |
| `npm run eval:fp-replay` (this repo vs `main`) | 0 changed files, 0 flags | 9 changed files, 0 flags |
| bench `parse_file/100_line_ts` | 408 µs | 402 µs |
| bench `diff_nodes/representative_ts` | 33.1 µs | 33.4 µs |
| bench `analyze_all/25_drifted_files` | 21.4 ms | 22.5 ms (+5.1%) |

Phase 1 adds `structural.rs` (tree-sitter query matching with cached compiled queries,
text-fallback contract) and ports `eval-call` to it: `eval?.()`, `window.eval`,
`globalThis.eval` now caught; `eval(` inside strings/comments no longer flags.

| Metric | Phase 2 (rule ports) |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test` | 114 passed, 0 failed |
| `cargo clippy` | clean |
| `npm run eval:engine` | 15/15 |
| `npm run test:unit` / `test:e2e:web` | 54 / 2 passed |
| fp-replay | 9 changed files, 0 flags |
| bench `analyze_all` | 24.4 ms (+14.0% vs baseline) |

Phase 2 ports `fn-constructor`, `tls-reject-false`, `broadened-cors`, `removed-if-guard`,
and `verify-to-decode` to structural matching. New catches: quoted object keys
(`{"rejectUnauthorized": false}`, `{"origin": "*"}`), constant-falsy guards (`if (0)`,
`if (null)`, `if (undefined)`), and crypto downgrades masked by `verify` surviving only in
a comment. New silences: any of these patterns inside strings or comments.

Performance note: the first bench run after the ports hit +21.5% (each structural rule
re-parsed the node snippets independently) — over the gate. A per-thread memo of the most
recent snippet parses (one parse per snippet per node, shared across rules) brought it
back to +14.0%. The residual is the real cost of running live tree-sitter queries.

| Metric | Phase 3 (differential family) |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test` | 119 passed, 0 failed |
| `cargo clippy` | clean |
| `npm run eval:engine` | 20/20 (5 new cases) |
| `npm run test:unit` / `test:e2e:web` | 54 / 2 passed |
| fp-replay | 14 changed files, 0 flags |
| bench `analyze_all` | 24.3 ms (+13.6% vs baseline) |

Phase 3 adds the differential rules — true before-vs-after comparisons only a diff-native
engine can express:

- **Loosened validation regex** (`loose-regex`, differential path): paired regex literals
  compared for weakening — widened to a catch-all, anchors dropped, or length bound
  removed — with the description naming exactly what weakened. Tightening stays quiet.
- **Guard removed** (`guard-removed`): a call whose every before call-site sat inside an
  `if` consequence now runs unconditionally.
- **Error handling removed** (`removed-try-catch`): a `try` that wrapped calls is gone
  while the calls remain.
- **Removed sanitization** upgraded to structural callee comparison: `sanitize` surviving
  only in a comment no longer masks the removal; wrapper-stripping
  (`save(escapeSql(x))` → `save(x)`) is caught.

Eval-driven engine fix: the new `if (0)` case failed through the real binary because
exported functions aren't split into body-level child nodes and `removed-if-guard` only
looked at `IfStatement` nodes. The structural matcher made it safe to lift that
restriction to any Modified node — the case now passes, and the payments-api fixture's
flag set is unchanged.

Note: fp-replay measures this branch against `main`; at Phase 0 the branch has no engine
changes yet, so 0/0 is expected. The meaningful fp-replay reads come at later phases once
rules change — the gate is that benign drift in this repo's own history stays quiet.

| Metric | Phase 4 (adversarial loop) |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test` | 124 passed, 0 failed |
| `cargo clippy` | clean |
| `npm run eval:engine` | 20/20 |
| `npm run test:unit` / `test:e2e:web` | 54 / 2 passed |
| fp-replay | 14 changed files, 0 flags |
| bench `analyze_all` | 26.3 ms (+22.9% vs baseline) |

Phase 4 ran three adversarial red-team rounds (subagents constructing in-scope evasions
and false positives), each finding fed back as a failing test → fix → regression test:

- **Round 1 — 8 findings, all fixed.** Headline: `guard-removed` fired on the single most
  common guard refactor — `if (x) { f() }` → `if (!x) return; f()` — a false positive that
  would have gotten the tool roasted on sight. Now suppressed via guard-clause detection.
  Also: `verify-to-decode` now requires the decode to be newly introduced and matches async
  name variants; `removed-try-catch` ignores `.catch()` conversion; `broadened-cors` catches
  `origin: ['*']`; `loose-regex` treats `{n,}` as unbounded, flags anchored catch-alls, and
  skips position-pairing when literal counts differ.
- **Round 2 — 3 findings, all self-inflicted by round-1 fixes, all fixed.** `is_guard_clause`
  used `starts_with` so `returnStatus = …` wrongly read as a guard clause (would suppress a
  real removal) — fixed to whole-keyword matching. `verify-to-decode`'s `parse` prefix caught
  generic `parseInt`/`parseFloat` — narrowed to `decode*` / exact `parse`.
- **Round 3 — clean.** No new in-scope findings; prior fixes verified intact.

Performance gate decision: the gate was a self-imposed ~15% pre-estimate; the measured cost
is +22.9% on the 25-file synthetic batch, i.e. ~5 ms total or ~0.2 ms per changed file. The
live watcher re-analyzes one file per debounced save, where this is imperceptible, and the
detection gain (structural + differential matching, adversarially hardened) is the point of
the release. Accepted as a reasoned trade rather than cripple detection to hit an invented
number. A future parse-once-per-node shared-tree refactor (rules currently re-run queries
against a memoized parse) would recover most of it without touching detection — logged for
v0.4.

## Blind-agent scorecard

The deterministic, CI-gated engine eval (`npm run eval:engine`) covers all five new cases
and runs them through the real binary: **20/20**. That is the gate that can't go green on
broken detection.

The advisory blind-agent scorecard (`npm run eval:agent`) scores model-generated review
answers against the frozen v3 rubric. It is **not** re-run here: a faithful rescore needs
fresh *blind* model answers for the new cases, and generating those inside the change that
adds the cases would defeat the blindness the scorecard depends on. Left pending fresh
blind answers — the same "independent validation pending" posture the v1→v3 history already
takes, rather than a self-graded number.

## Known out-of-lane evasions

In-scope red-team findings became tests and fixes (above). These surfaced evasions are
genuine but require analysis Diff Drift deliberately does not do — they stay documented
limits rather than scope creep into a different product's lane.

| Evasion | Why out of lane |
| --- | --- |
| `const e = eval; e(x)` — aliasing a sink to a local then calling it | Needs local dataflow to know `e` binds `eval` |
| `import { decode as parseToken }` then `parseToken(t)` | Needs import-binding / symbol resolution |
| CORS `origin` callback that returns `"*"` conditionally | Needs to evaluate a function's return value |
| `if (1 === 2)` / `if (a && !a)` always-false guards | Needs constant-folding / expression evaluation |
| try/catch removed but a real `.catch()` exists elsewhere unrelated | `.catch()` anywhere suppresses — accepted false negative (favours quiet over a false alarm) |
| `validateForm()` renamed to `checkForm()` (still validating) | A rename is indistinguishable from a removal without cross-symbol tracking; Low severity, dismissable |
| Regex `/^[A-Z]+$/m` — multiline flag weakens anchors semantically | Needs flag-aware regex semantics; rare in agent drift |
| `guard-removed` across deeply nested `if` consequences | Consequence text is re-parsed standalone; recovery is reliable for simple guards, so deep nesting may under-count and miss — errs toward silence, never a false alarm |
